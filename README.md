HiG Lecture Review Alpha test 1
===============================

Hi! And thanks for participating in the first alpha test of HiG Lecture Review. HiG Lecture Review is an app where you can vote on various qualities of a lecture, comment on it, and share your views with other attendants. All anonymously.

The goal is to share your experience with other lecture attendants, and give teachers a way to work on the qualities of their lectures. For the time being we ask that you refrain from leaving unhelpful comments, or anything that could be considered harassment or bullying in some way. We're still working on a way to filter out such comments.

Here's the APK file. Download or transfer it onto your Android device and install it. You may have to enable untrusted sources in your device' securtiy menu. [Download APK file](https://github.com/Chipmunk-Unlimited/Lecture-Feedback/raw/alpha-test/HiG%20Lecture%20Review%20Alpha%20test.apk).

If you have any feedback about the application, such as bugs, expectations or feature requests, please post them here as issues, or as replies to the invite you received from either Knut Remi LÃ¸vli or Joakim Stien. Please include the alpha number as well. In this case the alpha number is 1.
